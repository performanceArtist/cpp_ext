# Reusable C++ code
Generic classes and functions. Modern compiler is a requirement due to C++11 standard usage. I only compiled it in VS 2017.

## functional
Function wrappers(functional, algorithm) for cleaner code. Mostly to work with vectors.

## Task
Callback(Task) interface class + manager to run them(Task here is just another way to say callback). Manager usage is not mandatory, you can easily run it in a loop or a thread.
