# Reusable C++ code

## Summary

Generic classes and functions. Modern compiler is a requirement due to C++11 standard usage. I used VS 2017.

## Contents

### functional

Function wrappers(functional, algorithm) for cleaner code. Mostly to work with vectors.

### Task

Callback(Task) interface class + manager to run them(Task here is just another way to say callback). Manager usage is not mandatory, you can easily run it in a loop or a thread.
